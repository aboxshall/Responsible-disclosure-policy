======================

At {Company name}, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present. If you've discovered a vulnerability, please don't share it publicly until the vulnerability is fixed. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our clients and our systems. To report a security issue, please do the following:
<ul>
	<li>E-mail your findings to {Security@domain.tld}. If the report contains highly sensitive information, please encrypt your findings using our {PGP key} to prevent this critical information from falling into the wrong hands.</li>
</ul>
Please follow these rules when testing/reporting vulnerabilities:
<ul>
	<li>Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered, for example by downloading more data than necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.</li>
	<li>Do not read/modify or delete data that isn't you own.</li>
	<li>We ask you not to disclosure the problem to third parties until it  has been resolved.</li>
	<li>Note that the scope of the program is limited to technical vulnerabilities in {company name} web applications and {any additional service} please do not try to test physical security or attempt phishing attacks against our employees, and so on.</li>
	<li>Out of concern for the availability of our services to all users, please do not attempt to carry out DoS attacks, leverage black hat SEO techniques, spam people, and do other similarly questionable things. We also discourage the use of any vulnerability testing tools that automatically generate significant volumes of traffic.</li>
</ul>
What we promise:
<ul>
	<li>We will respond to your report within 3 business days with our evaluation of the report and an expected resolution date.</li>
	<li>If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal action against you in regard to the report.</li>
	<li>We will keep you informed during all stages of resolving the problem.</li>
	<li>To show our appreciation for your effort and cooperation during the report, we will list your name and a link to a personal website/social network profile on the page below so that the public can know you've helped keep {company name} secure.</li>
</ul>
